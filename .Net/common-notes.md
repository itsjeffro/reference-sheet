# Common notes

## literal string

* When you ran your code, you saw that the message Hello World! was printed to the output pane. When the phrase is surrounded by double-quotation marks in your C# code, it's called a literal string. In other words, we literally wanted the characters H, e, l, l, o, and so on, sent to the output. You'll learn about literal strings in the module titled Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C#.
