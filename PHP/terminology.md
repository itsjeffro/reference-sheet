# Terminology

## Concrete Class

The class which implements an interface is called the Concrete Class.

Example

```php
interface BarInterface
{
    public function doTheThing(): string;
}

class Bar implements BarInterface
{
    public function doTheThing(): string
    {
        return 'Did the thing';
    }
}
```
